# AI Legacy Application Modernization - Architecture Document

## 1. System Overview

This Proof of Concept (PoC) aims to demonstrate a system that modernizes legacy applications by providing a natural language interface to interact with existing APIs and web applications. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret user requests, Message Control Protocol (MCP) to standardize API interactions, and web crawling capabilities to extract and enrich data from various sources.

## 2. Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Natural language interface for interacting with legacy APIs
- API integration layer using MCP for standardized communication
- Web crawling capabilities to extract data from web applications
- Data enrichment through LLM processing
- User-friendly frontend for demonstration purposes
- Ability to translate natural language queries into API calls
- Capability to present API responses in human-readable format

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability to handle multiple API integrations
- Security for API authentication and data handling
- Extensibility to add new API connectors
- Performance optimization for real-time interactions
- Maintainability through modular architecture

## 3. System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

### 3.1 Core Components

#### 3.1.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine
- Integrates with LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4)
- Processes user queries in natural language
- Extracts intent, entities, and parameters from queries
- Generates human-readable responses from API data

#### 3.1.2 Message Control Protocol (MCP) Layer
- Standardizes communication between components
- Provides a unified interface for API interactions
- Handles message routing and transformation
- Manages API authentication and session handling

#### 3.1.3 API Connector Framework
- Provides adapters for different API types (REST, SOAP, GraphQL)
- Handles API-specific request formatting
- Processes API responses into standardized format
- Manages API rate limiting and error handling

#### 3.1.4 Web Crawler Engine
- Extracts data from web applications
- Navigates web interfaces programmatically
- Identifies and extracts relevant information
- Processes and structures extracted data

#### 3.1.5 Data Enrichment Service
- Combines data from multiple sources
- Applies LLM processing for data enhancement
- Generates insights and additional context
- Formats enriched data for presentation

#### 3.1.6 Frontend Interface
- Provides user input mechanisms (text, voice)
- Displays processed results in a user-friendly format
- Offers visualization options for complex data
- Supports interactive exploration of results

### 3.2 Data Flow

1. User submits a natural language query through the frontend
2. NLP Engine processes the query to determine intent and extract parameters
3. MCP Layer routes the request to appropriate API Connector or Web Crawler
4. API Connector/Web Crawler retrieves data from target systems
5. Data Enrichment Service processes and enhances the retrieved data
6. NLP Engine generates a human-readable response
7. Frontend presents the response to the user

## 5. Component Interactions

### 5.1 MCP Interface Design

The Message Control Protocol (MCP) interface will standardize communication between system components using a JSON-based message format:

```json
{
  "message_id": "unique-identifier",
  "message_type": "request|response|error",
  "source": "component-identifier",
  "destination": "component-identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  "payload": {
    "intent": "action-intent",
    "parameters": {},
    "data": {},
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
```

### 5.2 LLM Integration Approach

The LLM integration will follow these principles:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully designed prompts to extract structured information from user queries
2. **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation context for multi-turn interactions
3. **Few-Shot Learning**: Providing examples to guide LLM behavior
4. **Output Parsing**: Structured parsing of LLM outputs into actionable formats
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Handling cases where LLM interpretation is uncertain

### 5.3 Web Crawler Design

The web crawler component will:

1. **Site Analysis**: Automatically analyze site structure
2. **Navigation Mapping**: Create navigation paths for data extraction
3. **Data Extraction**: Extract structured data from web pages
4. **Session Management**: Handle authentication and session persistence
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respect website policies and prevent overloading

## 6. Security Considerations

- API credentials will be securely stored and managed
- User data will be processed with appropriate privacy controls
- Web crawling will respect robots.txt and site policies
- Authentication mechanisms will be implemented for all components
- Data transmission will be encrypted

## 7. Scalability and Future Expansion

The PoC is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for:

- Addition of new API connectors
- Integration with additional LLM providers
- Enhancement of web crawling capabilities
- Expansion of data enrichment features
- Development of domain-specific processing modules

## 8. SaaS Transformation Path

To transform this PoC into a SaaS product, the following steps are planned:

1. Implement multi-tenancy architecture
2. Develop user management and billing systems
3. Create a connector marketplace for API integrations
4. Implement usage monitoring and analytics
5. Develop deployment automation for cloud environments
6. Establish SLAs and support infrastructure

## 9. Implementation Phases
